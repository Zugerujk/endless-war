All the innocent little gamers of the village were scared of the big bear for if he saw them !dabbing he’d rip them limb from limb! They had to hide in their homes when he came around, !dabbing under their breath and gaming with the TV muted. It was a horrible time for everyone. \nThat was the first page, be sure to buy the full book!",

Today, we'll be examining the phenomenon of 'Door Gunning', a new prank pulled by the upstarts of Little Chernobyl. In order to explain it, we must first look at a certain subculture of people there, known as half-deads. These folks live so close to the radiation of Little Chernobyl Power Plant that the radiation has more than killed them and fully decayed their minds. The problem is, they can't !revive either. They are so brain dead that ENDLESS WAR doesn't know what to do with them. So functionally, they exist as these wildly disfigured, basically immortal suburbanites. Door Gunning takes advantage of this. A prankster will knock on the door of some hapless half-dead person, and shoot them repeatedly in the face. It's incredibly painful, but since nobody dies it gets passed off as harmless fun. It really makes you think, eh?",

Charcoal Park's efforts to fight back against hostile secreatures. You see, most districts are under Slimecorp's protection, excluding gangsters. However, Charcoal Park was such a forgettable place that they just forgot to send relief over there. Things have gotten so dire that many of the region's blue collar workers have banded together to form a militia of their own. There were many casualties at first, but intense training has turned the region into an sort of anarchist paradise. You wouldn't know it, though. To this day, their houses are kept very clean.",

    "It's time for 'Our Deep Fuck City', where we run documentaries on the mystique of each district. Most NLACakaNM citizens stay indoors for obvious reasons. Because of this, we're often oblivious to the interesting new social patterns they exhibit in this isolation. For example, Old New Yonkers has developed its own sect of Christianity. The practitioners of Neo-Protestant Milwaukeeism are convinced that ENDLESS WAR is the second coming of Christ, and that they have all been sent to Hell for their sins. Beyond that, most of the differences lie in the amount of self-flaggellation there is. NLACakaNM is a place of extremes, so what actually takes place is pretty mild compared to what else we've seen here. But despite its modesty, those folks may well be the most miserable in the city.",
    "It's time for 'Our Deep Fuck City', where we run documentaries on the mystique of each district. It's time to talk about the disappearing statue of Thalamus J. Crookline that stands in Globule Plaza. You see, Crookline's bandits have developed an inflated sense of honor among themselves. Part of that means they'll often wish themselves luck on that particular statue for good fortune in their pilfering. Every thief knows this, so it's not surprising how often the damn thing gets stolen. Hence the 'disappearance'. It costs the government like 1,000,000 slime a year just to maintain it.",
